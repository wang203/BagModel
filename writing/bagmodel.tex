The training data are $\{B_n, y_n\}$, $n\in[1,N]$, N is the total number of day\_geo bins, $B_n=\{b_{nm}\}, m\in[1,M]$, $M$ is a constant as the number of selected user for each day\_geo bin. 
$B_{nm}=\{b_{nmk}\}, k\in[1,K]$, $K$ is a constant as the number of images selected for each user. 
$B_n\subset\{U_n\}$ and 
$B_{nm}\subset\{I_{Un}\}$.
For example, each $U_n=\{u_i\}, i\in[1,N_{Un}]$ represents all the users in each day\_geo bin and $Img_{nm}=\{Img_j\}, j\in[1,N_{UnImg}]$ are all the images from each user.
The descriptor set is $D$ for each entry in set $B$.

Our objective function is $f: B\to Y$. $d_{nmk} = \phi_I(\rho_I(Img_{nm}))$ and $d_{nm} = \phi_U(\rho_U(U_n))$. 
Function $\phi$ is to aggregate the features of a constant number of entries selected by function $\rho$. Finally we'll learn a MLP to get $d_n = \Phi(d_{nm})$.
